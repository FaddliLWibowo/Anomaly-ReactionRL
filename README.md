# AnomalyDetectionRL

Trying to use Reinforcement Learning to detect anomalies.

The dataset used is the well known NSL-KDD with data of multiple anomalies

Using deep Q-Learning with keras to generate the network

AD.py presents the simple anomaly detection

mAD.py presents the multiple anomaly detection
